A vacuum cleaner robot uses obstacle avoidance technology to navigate rooms autonomously. Equipped with sensors like infrared or ultrasonic, it detects and avoids obstacles in real-time. The robot adjusts its path to clean efficiently, ensuring thorough coverage while preventing collisions with furniture, walls, or objects in its environment.


1. A vacuum cleaner robot uses obstacle avoidance technology for autonomous navigation.
2. Sensors like infrared, ultrasonic, or LiDAR detect obstacles in real-time.
3. The robot scans its environment continuously to identify objects like furniture and walls.
4. When an obstacle is detected, it calculates an alternative path.
5. Algorithms ensure efficient coverage of the entire area while avoiding collisions.
6. It autonomously cleans without human intervention.
7. Ideal for maintaining cleanliness in homes and offices.
8. The robot can reach hard-to-access areas, ensuring thorough cleaning.
